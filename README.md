# CaBot

CaBot (Carry on Robot) is an AI suitcase to help people with visually impairments travel independently. Can you imagine to walk around at airports without vision? Itâ€™s huge open space and there are lots of things and people, so that it is really dangerous for them to walk around at airports.

With CaBot, people with visually impairments will be able to enjoy their travel time more freely, and they will be free from asking someone to help.
